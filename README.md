# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: SQL Injection (SQLi)
  - An sql injection is found at the following url: /blue/public/salesperson.php?id=1 where the id parameter can be exploited with an   sql injection. A simple injection was performed with the sql sleep(5)=0 command as a proof of concept. Using this vulnerability an attacker can identify various databases, tables, and columns, then use that information to perform a data dump.

Vulnerability #2: Session Hijacking
 - The session id of an authenticated user was hijacked and used by an attacker to bypass user login. Session ids can be hijacked by sniffing the network, orchestrating an XSS attack, or predicting the token.

## Green

Vulnerability #1: Username Enumeration
- In this scenario, we are able to collect a valid username by interacting with the authentication mechanism on the login page. Typing in an invalid username results in a login error message that is not bolded. When we type in a valid username, in this case jmonroe99, the login error message becomes bolded. By knowing a valid username, an attacker can perform a brute force attack on the website to guess the password.

Vulnerability #2: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- A stored XSS vulnerability is present at /green/public/contact.php where an anonymous user can submit feedback. This vulnerability can be used to steal sensitive information from an unsuspecting user such as cookies, session tokens, or credentials. In our scenario, we are injecting an alert('My name is    ') as proof of concept. The website is not properly sanitizing script tags. Capitalizing the "I" in script bypasses sanitization. script --> scrIpt

## Red

Vulnerability #1: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
