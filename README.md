# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: SQL Injection (SQLi)
  - An sql injection is found at the following url: /blue/public/salesperson.php?id=1 where the id parameter can be exploited with an   sql injection. A simple injection was performed with the sql sleep(5)=0 command as a proof of concept. Using this vulnerability an attacker can identify various databases, tables, and columns, then use that information to perform a data dump.

Vulnerability #2: Session Hijacking
 - The session id of an authenticated user was hijacked and used by an attacker to bypass user login. Session ids can be hijacked by sniffing the network, orchestrating an XSS attack, or predicting the token.
